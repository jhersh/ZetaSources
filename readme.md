# ZetaSources

Swift data sources for your `UITableView` and `UICollectionView`. ZetaSources takes advantage of several powerful new features in Swift 2:

- A `ZetaSources` protocol **with default implementations** for table and collection view data source methods
- `guard` and early returns
- More to come!

ZetaSources requires Xcode 7 and aspires to be a pure Swift 2 take on [SSDataSources](https://github.com/splinesoft/SSDataSources).
